WARNING: [Synth 8-4767] Trying to implement RAM 'memory_reg' in registers. Block RAM or DRAM implementation is not possible; see log for reasons.
Reason is one or more of the following :
	1: RAM has multiple writes via different ports in same process. If RAM inferencing intended, write to one port per process. 
	2: Unable to determine number of words or word size in RAM.
